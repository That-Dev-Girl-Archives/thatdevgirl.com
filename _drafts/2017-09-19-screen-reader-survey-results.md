Last month, I launched a survey to help me answer some lingering questions I have had about what tools screen reader users user to navigate websites.  Specifically, I wanted to learn about how users interact with links on a site.

## What is this survey all about?

This question of screen reader user interaction stemmed from the fact that [unique link text](/blog/unique-link-text-is-important) is an important aspect of an accessible website. Among many other reasons, one rationale that I have come across for unique link text is the fact that screen reader users can navigate a page via an alphabetical list of all links.  However, the _(very few)_ users I know do not use that list.  I wanted to see if this links list is widely used and _(sadly)_ [WebAIM's screen reader survey](http://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey6/) does not contain this information.

So, I created my own _(very short)_ screen reader survey. The goal is to get a clearer picture around how screen reader users use the navigation features of their readers.  The survey focuses on the links list, the landmarks list, and the headings list.

The [survey is still open](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/XTV2PSD), but since I have been collecting responses for one month now, I thought I would share my findings so far.

## Survey basics

The survey consisted of 8 questions.  I asked respondents about how often they used a screen reader, which one(s) they use, how often they use a reader, and if they have ever used the reader's landmarks list, headings list, or links list.

I have received (so far) 42 responses. Of those 42 respondents, 35 of them use a screen reader at least some of the
time.
